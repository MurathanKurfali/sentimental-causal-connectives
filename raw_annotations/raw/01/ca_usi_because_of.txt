For those of you who think EMS providers over reacted , I would like to see you respond next time , not knowing at first what chemical you are dealing with , and trying to get people out of ..

One of the major points of the article , if you deigned lay your gentle eyes on it , was that there was also pervasive anti-Asian discrimination in the universities because of their academic predominance that goes far beyond their proportion of the population , to the point where Asian-Americans are purposely under-represented in some U.S. schools with AA programs despite them being the type of visible minority those prog..
