Anybody who plays sport evidently did n't give up those games . Most of them are happier because of it .  As for practical value - if you want to completely disregard the idea that excellence for excellence 's sake is praiseworthy ; then you 've got : prize money , sponsorship money , physical fitness , personal satisfaction and the ability to get..

Yes , I would have missed out on half of your life but because of me now you have to miss out on all of it .  Looking back I 'm not sure either of us tried hard enough to work things out . Or maybe we tried too hard and ignored our feelings . It seemed impossible to know what the " right " thing to do was . Now I ..

..lenty of decent sunshine will be had but where the showers hit , they could be heavy and be accompanied by hail and thunder .  The chilly north flow will fed embedded disturbances which enhance shower activity throughout the UK and Ireland and it 's because of the somewhat vigorous ' lift ' created by surface heat and increasingly cold air aloft which raises a meteorological term known as ' lapse rate ' , a measure of temperature difference with height and the greater this is , the heavier the showers can..

..think you would have any choice if the government not only sold clothes but made them ?  There are problems with a market system , and it needs to be properly regulated to ensure we are not ripped off or sold shit , ( which it is n't in many areas , because of stupid politicians ) but it is a far better system than having anything run by the state . Just look at what has happened in China since they dumped Socialism .  The state has to provide certain things like defence and the police - because the marke..

Rafael Romero , from the Consejo Local de Produccion Agropecuaria , a small producer organization in Tavai , said they can not reach their production potential because of the uncertainties of market prices . He hopes Fairtrade market opportunities and the support of a minimum price could help them change that .

Different dioceses have different requirements and expectations , so it is possible that only part of your training could be done here because of the practical differences in parish administration , liturgy , etc. between the Church of England and other Anglican jurisdictions . If you did an ordination-preparation course with us , you may be asked to do a further year at a seminary in your ho..

.. , are the same basic outlines as you see in battles against the big supermarkets : passionate locals who fear the places where they live being laid waste , a massive corporation that wants to expand -- and local politicians who tend to run scared , because of the prohibitive costs of locking horns with such huge companies .  The Totnes story goes something like this . In February 2010 , a local wholefood business called Greenlife moved out of the High Street , to new premises on the town 's market square..

Women are particularly exposed to some of the factors that increase the risk of poor mental health because of the role and status that they typically have in society . The traditional roles for women from some ethnic groups living in the UK can increase their exposure to these risks .  more women than men are the main carer for their children and they may c..

Things got a bit ugly after Harris started talking about the virtues of " personal responsibility " , which is always a suspect phrase because it implies that poor people are n't poor because of the circumstances of their upbringing , disability , disprivilege ? -- ? nah , they 're just too feckless .

"  How can Syria give Iran physical access to Lebanon with them sharing no border ?  " ... around Iran is the Persian Gulf " ? ? In your effort to defend the geographic and strategic idiocy o..

..o vote , Green . Disgruntled constituents seldom threatened to vote Labour or Conservative . I took that to mean they were only mildly dissatisified .  It is really a pity that those who intend to save the planet from global agression are prosecuted because of their ideals , and non violent acts trying to defend the environement , no matter in wich country.Nowadays Britain and its population face this problem as well as it did not relly exist , just the same as in other western nations .  Yes of course th..

Compared with Spanish teenagers , they look inmaculate . The Germans stick out because of their height , especially the kids .  In London , I can tell a Spaniard even before they open their mouth . So , I guess we all recognise " our own " . They dress very practically , speak very loudly , no make up and always with a rucksack attached ..

..day - the dive or ' simulation ' .  Northernlights25 . So football is a different ball game to cricket ? Well I never ! One of the myths the Australian press has invented is that Australia only lost the 2nd test in 2005 by ' a couple of lousy runs ' because of the umpires . This was reflected in the SMH who put the incident in their ' top ten bad referee/umpire decisions of all time ' list . While it 's true the catch in the 2nd test did come off the glove , it was n't until the next day - and after endle..

..f Wayne Rooney -- they do n't seem to be in the market for an extremely expensive understudy .  The other thing to bear in mind is that none of these clubs came in for Fellaini in the summer , so why would they bid massive money now ?  The outsiders because of the kind of dough it would involve are Arsenal , although they would be the club with the most motivation . With their season already going a bit awry and a number of their summer signings failing to impress , you would n't be surprised if Arsene We..

..nterprise of achieving it artificially -- the field of " artificial general intelligence " or AGI -- has made no progress whatever during the entire six decades of its existence .  Despite this long record of failure , AGI must be possible . That is because of a deep property of the laws of physics , namely the universality of computation . It entails that everything that the laws of physics require physical objects to do can , in principle , be emulated in arbitrarily fine detail by some program on a gen..

Patient care would improve and mortality rates would fall , experts have said , and savings would be made because of more efficient diagnosis and treatment .

Worse , apart from the 10 women in every 2,000 given unnecessary treatment , a further 200 will experience weeks or months of unnecessary worry solely because of ' false-positive ' findings -- the observation of ' cell changes ' that eventually turn out to be benign .

How bad could it be if he won reelection ?  Plenty bad , it turned out -- though not because of anything Nixon himself did . The real harm was the eventual disaffection of the Democratic Party from the labor cause . Two years after the debacle in Miami , Nixon was gone and Democrats won a landslide victory in the 1974 midterm election . But th..
